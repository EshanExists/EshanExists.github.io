		Journal
	</h1></center>


	<h2>
		Day 1:
	</h2>

	<li> 
		We worked on Creating our projects on our first day! It was really fun and I had the idea of a pen and hand, like your writing a journal. 

	</li>

	<h2>
		Day 2:
	</h2>

	<li> 
		We worked on a seperate "piano project" where we worked on tiles and cursor movement! I did a maze game for the tiles, where you start on the left and follow the yellow tiles when you move over them. It doesn't have a restart system or a rule, so it kinf of tests your personal diligence. 

	</li>

	<h2>
		Day 3:
	</h2>

	<li> 
		We worked on our project more and I had a lab to make it cooler! It now has actual hyperscroll which I expiremented with. It looks really cool and looks more like what I had in mind. 

	</li>

	<h2>
		Day 4:
	</h2>

	<li> 
		We worked on java and figured out how to make alerts on the webpage. I don't find this super exciting but this is still fun in a way :| 

	</li>

	<h2>
		Day 5:
	</h2>

	<li> 
		We worked on animations and css! It was super fun and I experimented with all the blues sublime text has. They have a ton! The animations are suuuupperrr satisfying! :D

	</li>

	<h2>
		Day 6:
	</h2>

	<li>  
		We worked pushing and improving all our projects. Connecting them together! I finally know how to push my website online! (Kinda, I lowkey forgot). 

	</li>

	<h2>
		Day 7:
	</h2>

	<li>  
		We worked on creating a "clock", it was pretty easy and straightforward. I had the song Disco Moreno in my head and made sure the image was a disco. (I know a bit cringe). I still want to add the song as the background though. 

	</li>

	<h2>
		GIT PUSH :
	</h2>

	<li>  
		git add .
		git commmit -m "adding stuff"
		git push

	</li>

	<h2>
		Cheat Sheet for Functions!
	</h2>

	<li>  
		console.log ()
		- Puts behaviours into the console
		math.random ()
		-generates random number and is a part of math
		addEventListener
		-  When scrolling or clicking, the Event Listener picks it up and does something based on that.


	</li>

	</li>

	<h2>
		Day 8:
	</h2>

	<li>  
		Today we learned about math.random and I saw a demonstration of it on the class. We haven't fully learned it yet as we haven't started actually using the random function yet in our own project. We instead made a cheat sheet (above) about some of the functions and what they do. Afterwards I worked on the jumpscare project which still needs work. I also have to push a lot of stuff and book a couple of labs to make everything work. 

	</li>
